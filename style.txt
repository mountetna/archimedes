Timur has four broad functions:

1. Display data
2. Support data entry
3. Query data
4. Visualize data

The implementation of these functions is in the top-level components, which
are currently:

Browse
Search
Map
Manifests
Plots
Help

To these we will later add:
Data
Worksheets

The four broad functions above are split up across these individual function -
that is, the application as a whole accomplishes those four tasks, but we
might e.g. do data entry or display through the Browse feature.
